# reconcilingViewpoints

This repository contains the scripts to run the analyses within "Reconciling diverse viewpoints within systematic conservation planning".

Scripts 1-4 involve reading in data, and running the viewpoint prioritisations in Zonation (data must be downloaded from cited sources beforehand).

Scripts 5-8 involve plotting the zonation output, running the aggregation approaches and evaluating efficiency and similarity to the protected area network. Data is avaiable to run these scripts: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dr7sqvb2w.
